Solutions for Advent of Code 2017

These are my solution programs.  I did them to entertain myself.  The original solutions are in C and Python.

I was chided by a friend that I didn't bother to use Common Lisp even when it didn't matter, so I redid most
of them in Common Lisp.  I stopped when I hit the socket code and lost interest.

Feel free to comment.  This was a learning exercise in Common Lisp for me.
